        Ismatou Barrie 
        I'm an Information Management and Techonology major and  I love and enjoy coding. I'm currently trying to find a concentration but it has been good so far.
        I don't really have any accomplishments regarding coding, but in highschool i did make a webside and gained a certificate from it.
        I'm a hairstylist, an artist(painter) and love to do craft. My favorite TV show is the Parkers. My favorite movie is Princess tiana. I'm the eldest of 3 kids. I love creativity and I have many talents.
        I'm here to win and gain experience.
